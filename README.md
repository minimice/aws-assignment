## Instructions

To deploy the application, clone this repo, change directory to Cloudformation, then run the following in order from the terminal:

```
aws --region us-east-1 cloudformation create-stack --stack-name ecs-networking --template-body file://ecs-networking.yml --capabilities CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM
```
```
aws --region us-east-1 cloudformation create-stack --stack-name ecs-public-service --template-body file://ecs-public-service.yml --capabilities CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM
```
```
aws --region us-east-1 cloudformation create-stack --stack-name rds-aurora-mysql --template-body file://rds-aurora-mysql.yml --capabilities CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM
```
This will deploy 3 stacks in the `us-east-1` region.  But you can deploy these in any region you deem appropriate.

1. **ecs-networking** provides the networking infrastructure (vpc, subnets, internet gateway, nat gateways, hosted zone record set).
2. **ecs-public-service** contains the service which defines the tasks (containers) to run.  The docker image used is retrieved from my [docker hub repo](https://hub.docker.com/r/minimice/php-app).  This is a php application which you can modify, it is referenced in [app/index.php](https://github.com/minimice/aws-assignment/blob/master/app/src/index.php).  The Dockerfile to build this image is stored [here](https://github.com/minimice/aws-assignment/blob/master/app/Dockerfile).
3. **rds-aurora-mysql** creates the Aurora RDS cluster with 2 MySQL database instances, one for failover purposes.

**Note: This is a demo only.**  You will have to make some minor changes by providing your own values in the Cloudformation templates.  The SSL certificate which I am using is  my own and used for the domain moocaholic.com.  Additionally code for connecting to the database including the username and password has to be provided in [app/index.php](https://github.com/minimice/aws-assignment/blob/master/app/src/index.php).  You will have to make these changes to your own Docker image and then push this image either to either Dockerhub (or Amazon ECR) and provide the URL to the **ecs-public-service** template.  Note that the retrieval of baby yoda in this demo is using Cloudfront, but that is *not* automated.
